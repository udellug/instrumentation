# Instrumentation; or, Making `choose` Fast

# Instrumentation

- What is it?
  - Code tracing
  - Debugging
  - Profiling
  - Performance counters
  - Data logging

???

What is it? - Software that hooks into an application to provide some of 5 main
things [0]

---

# Examples

[![New Relic logo](img/new_relic_logo.png)](https://newrelic.com)

???

Contrast secures web apps by hooking into their incoming and outgoing network
traffic and ensuring santization of user input

New relic does performance analysis and stuff (show the website
https://newrelic.com/)[1]

---

# Types of Instrumentation

- Binary
  - Hook into the compiled program, either assembly or possibly some IR

- Source
  - Modify the source code of the program

# A Concrete Example in Java
JK Java sucks.

This is where I'd put my Java example, if I had one.

Might do something with an LLVM "pass" in a future talk tho.

# Tool time!

## `choose`
## `perf`
## `flamegraph`

---

# `choose`

![Choose](img/choose_github.png )

???

My personal project, alternative to `awk` and `cut` designed to be more
ergonomic, and seeking to have on par or better performance.

Written in Rust, as all original software in the year 2019 was.[2]

---

# `perf`

> "Performance analysis tools for Linux"

???

- Linux command (starting in 2009) [3]
- "Performance analysis tools for Linux" - man page [5]

---

# `flamegraph`

![Flamegraph github](img/flamegraph_github.png)

???

Tool to visualize profiled code [6]

---

# A Closer Look at a Flamegraph

![img/cpu-mysql-updated.svg](img/cpu-mysql-updated.svg)

???

The x-axis shows "stack profile population", sorted alphabetically, i.e. the
x-axis is NOT time. The y-axis shows stack depth.[7]

# A Case Study

- [Rust regex
documentation](https://docs.rs/regex/1.3.4/regex/#example-avoid-compiling-the-same-regex-in-a-loop)
- [A
diff](https://github.com/theryangeary/choose/commit/f722cbcbbb61ba46c5d6e63d543a834c65a51751?diff=split
)

![:scale 60%](img/09ddbb4.svg)
![:scale 60%](img/f722cbc.svg)

???
- Early iteration of rust, just after achieving correctness
- rust regex crate clearly says don't recompile regex, it's slow
- but I did! and sure enough it was slow as hell
---

# Another Case Study
![:scale 50%](img/ee8df85.svg)
???
Shows that a lot of time is being spent in anonymous iterator functions
---
# Another Case Study

![https://github.com/theryangeary/choose/commit/3f1661f94919acf1744b9679773e6102eab6610c](img/latest_diff.png)
???
Zero cost abstractions is not the same as optimal algorithm!

# In Conclusion

# Star `choose` on GitHub
